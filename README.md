#### Horror visual novel game by Sisyphus Lab
In "The Neighbor Upstair" you step into the shoes of a lone university student, embarking on a new chapter of life away from home for the first time. As you settle into your new apartment, everything appears normal, offering a quiet reprieve from the hustle of university life.

However, this peace is soon disrupted when you encounter your unsettling neighbor upstairs. Navigate through an eerie narrative filled with suspense and unexpected twists, as you uncover the mysteries that linger just above you.
